Did the GIT is useful to the programmers and developers? yes/no: Yes

and why? ans: because it's allowing to work collaboratively. Software development projects usually require many people to work together. Git provides the developers with a systematic way of doing that. Thus, the developers focus on the project instead of extensive communication sessions between the other developers.
